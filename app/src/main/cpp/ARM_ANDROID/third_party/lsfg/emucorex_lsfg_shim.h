// C ABI for libemucorex_lsfg.so — the frame-generation backend, isolated in its own shared
// object and reached by dlopen/dlsym from GSLsfg.cpp.
//
// WHY A SEPARATE .so, AND WHY C
//
// LSFG's framegen links volk, which DEFINES 759 globals named vkCreateImage, vkQueueSubmit,
// and so on — exactly the names PCSX2's own VKLoader.cpp defines. Linking them into one
// library is a duplicate-symbol error at best. At worst the linker merges them and
// framegen's volkLoadDevice() call, which it makes against ITS OWN VkDevice, silently
// repoints every entry point the GS renderer uses. Every subsequent vkCmdDraw would go to
// the wrong device, and it would present as a driver crash with nothing pointing back here.
// A separate shared object gives volk its own copy of those globals, which is the only
// arrangement where both loaders can coexist.
//
// The interface is C because the app builds with ANDROID_STL=c++_static: each .so carries
// its own libc++, so an std::vector or std::function crossing this boundary would be two
// unrelated types that happen to share a name. Nothing here is richer than a pointer, an
// integer, or a function pointer.
//
// Errors come back as codes, never exceptions. framegen throws (LSFG::vulkan_error) and so
// does the DXBC translator; the shim catches everything and stores the message for
// emucorex_lsfg_last_error(). An exception must never reach the unwinder in the caller's
// shared object.
